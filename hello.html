    <h1>Hello, All! This is a demo project to learn Version Control System.</h1>

<p> Version control is the practice of tracking, managing, and organizing changes to files, primarily source code, over time using a version control system (VCS). It safeguards project assets, facilitates collaboration by allowing teams to work on the same files concurrently, and provides a historical record that enables developers to revert to previous versions if errors occur. Key benefits include improved code quality, streamlined development processes, and enhanced project visibility, with tools like Git being widely used for these purposes.  
How Version Control Works
1. Snapshots:
A VCS takes periodic "snapshots" or records of your project's files. 
2. History:
Each snapshot represents a specific version of the project, saving information about the changes, who made them, and when. 
3. Collaboration:
Multiple developers can access the same project repository, work on their own branches of the code, and merge their changes back into the main project. 
4. Reversion:
If a bug is introduced or an unwanted change is made, developers can easily go back to a previous, stable version of the code. 
Key Benefits of Version Control
Protection:
It acts as a safety net for source code, preventing catastrophic data loss or unintentional errors from damaging valuable project history. 
Collaboration:
Teams can work together efficiently, tracking individual contributions and avoiding conflicts. 
Auditing & Reproducibility:
All changes are recorded, creating an auditable trail that helps in debugging and ensures that the development process is transparent and reproducible. 
Flexibility:
Developers can experiment with new features on separate "branches" without affecting the main, stable version of the code. 
Efficiency:
By managing all versions in a single system, it eliminates the need for manual copying and helps streamline development timelines. 
Common Version Control Systems 
Git:
The most popular distributed version control system, known for its speed, efficiency, and powerful branching capabilities.
Subversion (SVN):
A widely used centralized version control system, particularly favored by some enterprises for its simpler structure.
